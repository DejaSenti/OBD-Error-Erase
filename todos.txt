HIGH PRIORITY BUGS:
	+ delphi won't respond to error column? test
		+ display the correct columns ONLY, not the entire fucking thing
	+ bmw map length -> dtc map location won't accept letters
	+ try erasing large amounts of errors, supposedly broken
	+ can't erase on same file twice
	+ manual map length needs to be (L + 1) * 2 for some reason to include whole map?
	+ delphi crash if length entered before new value
	+ delphi display should also display the right addresses (of the value start)
	+ delphi doesn't erase all duplicates
	+ bosch new value autocompletion doesn't work properly
	+ bmw algo map length autocalculation seems sus. check for wrong value
	+ creating profile and adding maps doesn't update map list until profile reload, throws exception
	+ requesting new profile when a profile is selected gets editor stuck on profile type
	- fix gui scaling etc.
	+ flip bytes is flipping adjactent positions instead
	- save profile should also update preview
	- select new subprofile should also update preview

PRODUCT CHANGES:
	+ remove select all presets
	+ add save profile button
	- drap and drop binaries
	+ manual width entry
	+ remove autoselect of all presets
	- save search words as 10 back and 50 forward, manage a list and add to it with each erase
	- on erase, the loaded file should not change
	- BMW algorithm RECALCULATES LENGTH EACH TIME ON SUBPROFILE LOAD


NICE TO HAVES:
	- no maps selected disables erase button
	- surround potential troublesome areas with try/catch statements and dump into log file
	- show last dtc value on display
	- when BMW algo selected, remove "Enter Length" in textbox
	- do validations on the text fields



+ populate map location and make sure that it's correct where needed
