TO PRETTIFY:
	- GUI graphics
	- GUI alignments


NICE TO HAVES:
	- new / duplicate profile button should send to editor tab

BEHAVIOURS:
	bosch:
		dtc default: 0000
		DO add width, add option to type in zero and get the right string length

		then round down to the row number using the ratio between the error width and the new value width


	delphi:
		single map: 0
		just type in the entire value, no need for width

		values:
			address
			height
			new value
			error column (8 bit)
