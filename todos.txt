HIGH PRIORITY BUGS:
	+ delphi won't respond to error column? test
		+ display the correct columns ONLY, not the entire fucking thing
	+ bmw map length -> dtc map location won't accept letters
	+ try erasing large amounts of errors, supposedly broken
	- can't erase on same file twice
	+ manual map length needs to be (L + 1) * 2 for some reason to include whole map?
	- delphi crash if length entered before new value
	- delphi display should also display the right addresses (of the value start)
	- delphi doesn't erase all duplicates
	- bosch new value autocompletion doesn't work properly
	- bmw algo map length autocalculation seems sus. check for wrong value

PRODUCT CHANGES:
	+ remove select all presets
	- add save profile button
	- drap and drop binaries
	+ manual width entry


NICE TO HAVES:
	- no maps selected disables erase button
	- surround potential troublesome areas with try/catch statements and dump into log file
	- show last dtc value on display
	- when BMW algo selected, remove "Enter Length" in textbox
