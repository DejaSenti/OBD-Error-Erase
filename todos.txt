HIGH PRIORITY BUGS:
	+ delphi won't respond to error column? test
		+ display the correct columns ONLY, not the entire fucking thing
	+ bmw map length -> dtc map location won't accept letters
	+ try erasing large amounts of errors, supposedly broken
	- can't erase on same file twice
	+ manual map length needs to be (L + 1) * 2 for some reason to include whole map?


PRODUCT CHANGES:
	+ remove select all presets
	- add save profile button
	- drap and drop binaries
	+ manual width entry


NICE TO HAVES:
	- no maps selected disables erase button
	- surround potential troublesome areas with try/catch statements and dump into log file
	- show last dtc value on display
	- do validations on the text fields

	- new profile -> create object, do not create file or update list
	- select profile -> cache object
	- duplicate profile -> create duplicate, update list, cache newly created one
	- remove profile -> remove cached object, update manufacturers and list
	- save profile -> if there is a cached object, remove it and save the current object, update manufacturers and list
